# 🧙 Alohomora - The spell to open your small businesses for big sales.


## What exactly is Alohomora?
Alohomora is an app that aims to combine the idea of social media and e-commerce. Essentially it’s an app just for sellers and buyers. The sellers can post the new products that they plan to sell just like Instagram Posts and buyers can directly contact them through the app.


## What problem does Alohomora solves?
The past year or so has been very tough for the entire year with Covid-19 grounding us in our homes. Many people lost their jobs, many face the threat of losing them in the future. Despite all the hardships, we still were able to see various small scale businesses spawn up. Be that setting up a business at home to online sales, people made utmost use of different technologies to scale up their business for the long term goal. Observing this and leveraging this wave of new potential business, we came up with the idea of Alohomora (a doorway which opens different possibilities for new small scale business to scale and reach new heights).


## What features does Alohomora provide?

💸 Payment Feature -  We have integrated Razorpay in order to have a smooth payment process providing all sorts of payment options. In future we plan to support international payments as well.

📷 Posts and Stories - The sellers can post the new products that they plan to sell just like Instagram Posts.we have features such as stories, live streams, etc to increase the potential reach of the products and some means to create hype for it.

📈 Review - potential buyers and other sellers can discuss the product in the comments section, they can like the product and even share a link to buy the product. This in turn works as an analytics section for sellers where they can get constructive feedback.

📱 Chat - We also have added a chats feature wherein the buyer can directly chat with the seller and can get personalized stuff. Not just this, with chats the buyer would also be able to bargain the price of the product just for him and personalise for customers' needs.


## What problems we faced?

🀄 So far the biggest challenge we faced during the development process was to have a consistent and modern UI.Along with this, keeping the UI minimal and planning it in such a way that the users (especially the sellers) don’t get overwhelmed with the various different features that we have. The solution (a quick time one) that we came up with was, integrating designs that the people are familiar with along with a design language that is unique to us. For example, we have the main feed which is similar to Instagram but with our design language and colour scheme with additional features. The chat is similar to WhatsApp but with minor tweaks and the addition of features such as bargaining of prices, etc.

⏲️Speaking from the development perspective, setting up the project for an efficient and seamless development process was a challenging one. We integrated Git and GitHub features heavily and plans to use other features such as GitHub Actions, Releases, Issue/PR Templates, Workflows, etc.

👾 The next major challenge was Flutter state management. State Management can easily get tricky and for a project of this scale, proper state management is required. We used Bloc for state management in Flutter. Flutter recently had a major update release, Flutter 2.0. Getting onboard these various features introduced by Flutter was a challenge in itself.

☁️ We also had a discussion regarding whether we should opt for a server or serverless architecture. After a few discussions, we decided on going serverless with Firebase Cloud Functions since we already were heavily relying on other Firebase Products. 

💻 We wanted to build a web app as well but couldn't furnish it so well because of time constraints.

## Technlogies we used in Alohomora 🖥️✨
- Flutter for the App.
- Firebase Firestore as the real-time Database.
- Firebase Phone Auth for Authentication and Authorization.
- Firebase Cloud Functions for serverless functionalities.
- Firebase Analytics
- Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for Push Notifications
- Cloudinary for Media Management
- Razorpay for Payments
- Agora for Real Time Voice and Video Engagements

## Future Plans: 📆
We have a bunch of ideas planned for the future. Following is a list of potential ideas.
- Integration of Stripe to support International Payments
- Support for Pagination and Async Storage for posts and chat.
- Audio and Video calls between buyers and sellers for more clarity.
- Addition of product release events for new upcoming products.
- Admin Panel for sellers, live updates regarding shipments.
